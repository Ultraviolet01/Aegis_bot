 * Reveals its children once, when they scroll into view.
 *
 * Deliberately not applied to the hero: content above the fold uses `.reveal`,
 * which animates on mount, because a visitor should never arrive to a blank
 * screen waiting on an observer. This is for everything below it.
 *
 * `once: true` — the entrance plays a single time. Re-animating on every
 * scroll-back would turn reading the page into watching it.
